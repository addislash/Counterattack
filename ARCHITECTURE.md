# Counterattack App Architecture

This document outlines the architecture and design decisions for the Counterattack water polo tournament management app.

## Architecture Overview

The app follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Presentation Layer (UI)**: React Native components and screens
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Services and utilities 
3. **Data Layer**: API interfaces and local storage

## Key Components

### UI Layer

- **Theme System**: Centralized theming with consistent colors, spacing, and typography
- **Component Library**: Reusable UI components built on React Native Paper
- **Navigation**: Stack and tab-based navigation using React Navigation

### Business Logic

- **Tournament Management**: Creating, joining and managing tournaments
- **Schedule Parsing**: Processing Excel files into structured data
- **Team Search**: Finding specific team games and schedules

### Data Management

- **API Services**: Interface with backend systems (mocked for now)
- **File Handling**: Excel file upload and processing
- **State Management**: Local state with React hooks

## Design Patterns

### Component Structure

Components are organized into:

- **Screens**: Full application views (pages)
- **Components**: Reusable UI elements 
- **Navigation**: Navigation configuration

### State Management

The app uses React's built-in state management:

- **Local Component State**: For UI-specific state
- **Context API**: For sharing state across components (future implementation)

## Data Flow

1. **User Input**: User interacts with UI components
2. **Business Logic**: Services and utilities process the input
3. **API Calls**: Send/receive data from backend (mocked)
4. **State Updates**: Update UI based on results
5. **Rendering**: Display updated information to user

## Excel File Processing

Tournament schedules are uploaded as Excel files and processed as follows:

1. **File Selection**: User selects .xlsx file using DocumentPicker
2. **File Upload**: File is uploaded to server (mocked)
3. **Parsing**: Excel is parsed to extract structured data
4. **Validation**: Data is validated for required fields
5. **Storage**: Parsed schedule is stored in database (mocked)
6. **Display**: Schedule is displayed in the app

## Styling Approach

The app uses a consistent styling approach:

- **Theme Constants**: Colors, sizes, and shadows defined in theme.js
- **StyleSheet**: Component-specific styles using React Native StyleSheet
- **Paper Components**: Using React Native Paper for material design components

## Error Handling

Error handling is implemented at multiple levels:

- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation for user inputs
- **API Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures
- **File Processing Errors**: Validation and error reporting for Excel files

## Future Architecture Enhancements

1. **State Management**: Implement Redux or Context API for global state
2. **Authentication**: Add secure user authentication flow
3. **Offline Support**: Add local storage for offline access
4. **Real-time Updates**: Implement WebSockets for live tournament updates
5. **Push Notifications**: Add notification service for game alerts

## Security Considerations

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated
- **File Validation**: Excel files are validated before processing
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication (future implementation)
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (organizer vs user)

## Performance Optimizations

- **Lazy Loading**: Import components only when needed
- **Memoization**: Using React.memo and useMemo for expensive calculations
- **List Virtualization**: For long tournament schedules

This architecture provides a solid foundation for the app while allowing for scalability and future enhancements.
